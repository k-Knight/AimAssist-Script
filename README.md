# Aimbot Script

### About

This script works on all games (unless the character is not in workspace)

Editable settings :

This script also has FOV customization, circle color, circle filled, circle thickness, circle radius (fov or size), circle position and how many sides does the circle have (set to 64 for a circle, anything below 3 won't work)
